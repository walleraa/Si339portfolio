            <p>Here's an image of what I was doing at the end of the summer. I got to round 202 and eventually stopped playing because I had lost interest and also because I was starting to hit a bit of a hardware limitation.</p> 
            <img src="images/BTD5/achievements1.jpeg" alt="An image showing a couple of my achievements" id="achievements1"/>
            <p>Here's an image showing a couple achievements, including track star, which is to beat every launch map at every difficulty, and mission accomplished, which is to beat every special mission.</p>
            <img src="images/BTD5/achievements2.jpeg" alt="An image showing a couple more achievements" id="achievements2"/>
            <p>Here's an image showing a couple more achievements, including ultimate agent, which is to get every special agent to pro, and ultimate specialist, which is to get every specialist building.</p>
            <img src="images/BTD5/nigh_impoppable.jpeg" alt="An image showing even more achievements" id="achievements3"/>
            <p>Here's an image showing a few more achievements, most notably Nigh Impoppable, which is earned by defeating 25 maps on Impoppable difficulty.</p> 
            <img src="images/BTD5/agents.jpeg" alt="An image showing a few agents" id="agents"/>
            <p>Here's an image showing a few of the special agents I got. It took a decent amount of time to earn all of the money to buy enough agents and then actually go and place all 50 agents to get them to pro status.</p>
            <img src="images/BTD5/specialist.jpeg" alt="An image showing a few specialty buildings" id="specialist"/>
            <p>Here's an image showing a few of the specialist buildings I have. It took a long time to get the money to get all of them (and even more time to get the surplus money that I can't spend).</p>
            <img src="images/BTD5/lab.jpeg" alt="An image showing a few lab upgrades" id="lab"/>
            <p>Here's an image showing a few of the lab upgrades I have. It took a long time to get the upgrades I have right now, and I'm still not even close to fully upgrading everything.</p>
            <img src="images/BTD5/tracks.jpeg" alt="An image showing my tracks completion" id="tracks"/>
            <p>Here's an image showing a the percentage of the medals I have for each map difficulty.</p>
